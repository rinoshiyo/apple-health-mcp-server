`apple-health-mcp-server` exposes the contents of your Apple Health export
(`export.xml` plus the ECG CSV and GPX route files Apple ships alongside it)
to any [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) client —
including Claude Desktop — through 16 read-oriented tools backed by a local
[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) database.

## Features

- **Comprehensive ingestion.** Imports `Record`, `Workout` (with
  `WorkoutEvent`, `WorkoutStatistics`, `WorkoutRoute`, and
  `WorkoutMetadataEntry`), `ActivitySummary`, `Correlation`, `Me`,
  `ExportDate`, ECG voltage samples, and GPX route points. Categorical
  state-of-mind entries (iOS 17+) land in a dedicated table.
- **All data stays local — no external transmission.** The importer reads
  files from disk, the server speaks MCP over stdio (HTTP is opt-in), and
  the only network artefact is whatever the client itself decides to send.
- **DuckDB-backed.** Re-imports are idempotent thanks to deterministic
  deduplication; ad-hoc analysis through `run_custom_query` runs at native
  DuckDB speed.
- **Time-zone aware.** GPX route timestamps are aligned to each parent
  workout's local offset so joins against XML-derived rows are clean.
- **Cross-platform.** Tested on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows against Python
  3.12 / 3.13 / 3.14.
- **100% branch-tested.** Every release gates on full coverage with
  `pytest --cov-branch --cov-fail-under=100`.

## Installation

The recommended entry point is [uvx](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), which
fetches a one-shot virtualenv on demand and never pollutes the system
Python:

```bash
uvx apple-health-mcp-server --help
```

### Claude Desktop

Add the following to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
(macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "apple-health": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["apple-health-mcp-server", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. Before the tools return anything useful, import
your data once:

```bash
uvx apple-health-mcp-server import /path/to/apple_health_export
```

The expected directory is the one Apple Health unzips for you (it
contains `export.xml`, an `electrocardiograms/` folder, and a
`workout-routes/` folder).

### Database location

By default the database lands at the XDG-resolved data directory:

- Linux / macOS: `~/.local/share/apple-health-mcp/health.duckdb`
- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\apple-health-mcp\health.duckdb`

Override with `--db /custom/path/health.duckdb` on either subcommand.

## Tools

16 tools are registered with FastMCP, grouped by family:

| Activity summaries | `get_activity_summaries` |
| Heart rate | `get_heart_rate_samples` |
| Correlations | `list_correlations`, `get_correlation_details` |
| ECG | `list_ecg_readings`, `get_ecg_data` |
| State of mind | `list_state_of_mind` |
| Metadata & ops | `list_data_sources`, `get_import_history` |
| Escape hatch | `run_custom_query` (read-only validated SQL) |
